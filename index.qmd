Hi! I am Zach. I am a 3rd year undergraduate student in UCSB majoring Environmental Studies. I am typically interested in renewable energy field. I am also a member of CETlab in ucsb, currently working with raw data and building models for electricity power grid system. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, landscape photographing, and car racing. I have hiked and camped in Iceland, Holland, US, and China. Feel free to poke around my website to learn more!
